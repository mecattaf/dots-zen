# Extensions

Here are a few simple guidelines to make an extension for Telescope:

## Examples

<!-- Please append your extensions at the bottom, not at the top. Also, make sure its inserted in the correct table -->

### Sorter

It's suggested to install one native sorter, for better performance

| Extension                                                                                | Description                                                                    |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [telescope-fzf-native.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope-fzf-native.nvim) | Native FZF sorter that uses compiled C to do the matching, supports fzf syntax |
| [telescope-fzy-native.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope-fzy-native.nvim) | Native FZY sorter that uses compiled C to do the matching                      |
| [telescope-zf-native.nvim](https://github.com/natecraddock/telescope-zf-native.nvim)     | Native zf sorter that prioritizes matches on filenames                         |

Below are benchmarks to show the performance difference between lua, fzf, and fzy. Done with an early version of `plenary.benchmark`. The benchmark was done by calculating the score for 240201 file strings in a table. For each `score > 0` we also calculated the positions (this is the slower part for both algorithms, and telescope tends to only do this for the displayed results, usually less than 50 entries).

The benchmark between fzf-native and fzy-native isn't that meaningful. The benefit of fzf-native is the support with the fzf syntax.
